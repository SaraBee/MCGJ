## Random Stuff You Need To Know

- You should put a file called `config.py` in `mcgj/mcgj` containing variables for `db` and `secret_key`. Secret key is for the secure session cookie. Even though it's client-side, it's encrypted. db is the database file.
- Set `spotipy` environment variables on the production server. :)
